Lenders in all protocols are only exposed to the risk of ETH and XAI at any given time. Lenders deposit funds into an isolated lending market consisting of Token ABC and the bridge asset only. If Token XYZ experiences an exploit, Token ABC lenders will not be affected since the risk is isolated to the Token XYZ market. In addition, since all tokens are paired with ETH or XAI, there is only a single market for every token asset, preventing fractured liquidity and allowing greater protocol efficiency. This is as opposed to pure lending pair approaches, where a new lending market is created for each additional pairing.DeFi Dapps",

    "Hashstack": "DeFi retail lending today is largely over-collateralized, requiring the borrower to provide collateral that exceeds the loan by an average of 42% in value.\u00a0\u00a0This creates two problems: (1.) Unless there is an absolute need, a borrower wouldn\u2019t opt for a loan that is less than the collateral they provide; (2.) By trading off the borrower\u2019s needs, a typical DeFi lending product creates a spiral-down effect, wherein a borrower does not opt for a loan without absolute need. Inconsistently deployed assets create volatility and sharp variation between supply and borrow APR, requiring the borrowers to provide higher APR for an already over-collateralized loan, disincentivizing them even further. Hashstack aims to solve these problems. It is a DeFi lending product that provides permissionless under-collateralized loans of up to 300% of the borrower\u2019s collateral. Their loans are designed to meet personal & trading capital needs without any added risks to liquidity providers, borrowers, or even the protocol itself.\u00a0\u00a0As a wallet\u2019s relationship with the protocol nurtures, its ability to borrow up to 300% LTV increases. This debt can be spent in two ways: (1.)Utilise the entirety of the debt as trading capital; (2.)Withdraw the debt equating up to 70% of the provided collateral into their personal wallet for personal needs; while utilizing the remaining debt as trading capital. In both options, the protocol retains the ownership of the debt while the borrower is given the right to spend. To enable effective loan spend as trading capital, Hashstack carefully curates the dapps, supported assets, and actions.DeFi Dapps",
